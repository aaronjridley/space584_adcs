# Space 584 - ADCS Project Information

## Level 1 Requirements

- Describe features on an object that are > 1 mm in size placed on a red ball that is 5 meters away and 25 cm across over the course of one minute.
- Be able to make such measurements within three minutes after being released at a 10 revolutions / s around a single axis.
- System must be able to desaturate wheel from 200 rev/s to less than 10 rev/s, with the structure rotating less than 1 deg/s within 2 minutes.
- Testbed must fully support testing of the above requirements.

## Testbed Requirements

- Must impart a rotational speed of up to 10 rev/s
- Must measure to measure the rotational speed to within 1 deg/s
- After initial speed of 10 rev/s is imparted, system should be spinning with at least 5 rev/s after 60s, with no external forces applied
- If magnets are used to levitate, then these need to be accounted for in B-field. Magnetic field must not change at the center as the structure rotates.
- Must be able to hold a 10cm x 10cm x 10cm cube with a 1 kg mass
- Wobble (angular deflection orthogonal to rotation axis) must be less than 5 deg
- Must provide a magnetic field at the structure mounting point that is at least 3x Earth's field, with a magnetic axis that is orthogonal to the rotation axis, and reproducible within 10%
- Orientation of the testbed can be horizontal or vertical, but must be disclosed as soon as possible
- Stars must be clustered around axis orthogonal to rotation axis
- Stars must cover at least half the "sky"
- S/C must be able to observe stars at least half the rotation
- Must be at least +/- 15 degrees of the equator, but could be more
- Stars must be of different brightnesses with many dim stars and only a few bright stars
- Star spacing must be highly varied (such that at any look orientation, the spacing can provide an orientation better than 1 mm over 5 meters, or 0.01 degrees)
- Star field map must be provided
- A large infrared source must be provided
- If representing the Sun, the source must be at least 30C above room temperature, placed in the starfield, and have a light on it so that it is brighter than the surrounding stars
- If representing the Earth, the source must be at least 10C above room temperature, placed opposite the starfield, and take up at least 90 degrees of the "field of view"
